### How to customize Wagtail CMS

> Codebase: related app, model, template, js 

**Rocket Django PRO** integrates Wagtail CMS as a Django application. The application can be found in the `apps/cms` folder. The model for categories and blog posts can be found in `apps/cms/models.py`.

```py
from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone
from wagtail.snippets.models import register_snippet
from wagtail.models import Page
from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel
from wagtail.fields import RichTextField
from django.contrib.auth.models import User


@register_snippet
class Category(models.Model):
    """A model representing a blog category."""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


class BlogPage(Page):
    """A model representing a blog page."""

    # Blog fields
    ...
    short_content = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
    content = RichTextField(null=True, blank=True)
    publishing_date = models.DateTimeField("Publishing Date", default=timezone.now)

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('author'),
        FieldPanel('thumbnail'),
        FieldPanel('category'),
        FieldPanel('short_content'),
        FieldPanel('content'),
        FieldPanel('publishing_date'),
    ]

    template = "apps/cms/blog_details.html"
```

The `Category` model is used to add categories to the blog posts. The `@register_snippet` decorator ensures the model is added as a model for a snippet. The `BlogPage` model is used to define the fields that should be present when creating a blog post. To learn more about how you can customize the Wagtail page models visit the [Wagtail Page Model](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/topics/pages.html) Documentation page.

The templates for the blog post are located in the `templates/apps/cms` folder. `blog_list.html` Lists the blog post that has been published in the `cms` section of **Rocket Django PRO**. `blog_details.html` outlines how the blog posts from the model should be displayed. These templates can be defined to suit your project needs.
